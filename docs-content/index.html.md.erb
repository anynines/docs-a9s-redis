## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

a9s Redis for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated Redis servers. App developers can create instances of a Redis server using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an app. The service runs on a single, dedicated VM, the size of which depends on your service plan.

a9s Redis for PCF automatically provisions service instances and creates a dedicated VM for each instance. This isolates service instances, preventing the "bad neighborhood" problem that can occur when multiple service instances run on a shared VM.

Because the service provisions VMs as needed, only existing service instances use infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service instances are destroyed. With on-demand provisioning, the number of service instances grows or shrinks with demand.

### <a></a>Current Features

a9s Redis for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| **OnÂ­-demand service instance provisioning** | a9s Redis for PCF deploys Redis instances automatically. Developers provision a single-VM Redis server using one `create-service` command. |
| **Service instance isolation** | Each Redis server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad-neighborhood protection and align with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Redis for PCF uses Cloud Foundry [application security groups (ASGs)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) to prevent network connections from unauthorized apps.
| **Smoke tests** | A post-deployment, smoke-test errand runs basic tests against your installation, ensuring that it is configured properly. |
| **Service instance capacity upgrade** | By updating your service plan, you can upgrade the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your Redis instances.  |
| **Logging and monitoring** | Each Redis service instance provides log messages and Redis-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment updater** | An updater errand updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Redis for PCF service instances to their latest version. |
