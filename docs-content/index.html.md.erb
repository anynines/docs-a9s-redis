## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated Redis
servers and clusters.<br />
a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform is part of a number of a9s Data Services available in one Bundle.
Visit the [anynines website](https://www.anynines.com/) for more details. Developers
can create instances of a Redis server or cluster using Apps Manager.

When you run the cf CLI `create-service a9s-redis` command, Pivotal Platform creates dedicated
VMs for this service instance. This allows the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

Redis service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely
automated. This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded
by infrastructure virtualization mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service instances
allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of service
instances is not limited by design.

### <a id='current-features'></a> Current Features
The current version of a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **On-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform deploys Redis instances automatically. Developers can provision a single VM Redis server or a multi VM server using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each Redis server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized apps.
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your Redis instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each Redis service instance provides log messages and Redis-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/Graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. |
| **Customazible Snapshots** | a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform supports RDB persistence with point-in-time snapshots.<br />This setting can be [changed by the user](./using.html#change-rdb-persistence-settings). |
| **High Availability** | a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform ensures high-availability using [Redis Sentinel](./using.html#ha-cluster-with-redis-sentinel).<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for Pivotal Platform ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. The user can modify Sentinel related settings like min\_slaves\_max\_lag and down\_after\_milliseconds. |
| **Improved Memory Handling** | a9s Redis for Pivotal Platform suports now a better memory handling. In addition, the user can modify the [maxmemory_policy](./using.html#change-maxmemory-policy). |
| **Service Dashboard** | The Service Dashboard provides a single sign on and lets the user easily trigger backups. |
| **Default Syslog Endpoints for Instances** | In the tile a default endpoint for syslog and Graphite can be configured for each service instances which is created by the end user. |
| **Consul Domain Configurable** | The consul domain can now be configured. |
| **BOSH DNS Handler** | a9s BOSH DNS handler added to make a9s service instances accessible from Diego cells. |
| **a9s-pg Backup** | Added backup option for a9s-pg. |
| **Instance Sharing** | a9s Redis no supports instance sharing between orgs an spaces, see [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html). |
