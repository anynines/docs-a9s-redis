This documentation describes the a9s Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s Redis for PCF
enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated Redis servers. Developers can
create instances of a Redis server using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line
interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an application.
Depending on your service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated virtual machine.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

When you run the cf CLI ```create-service a9s-redis``` command,
PCF creates dedicated virtual machines for this service instance. This allows
the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

Redis service instance provisioning, including virtual machine orchestration, is entirely automated.
This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on virtual machines, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of
service instances is not limited by design.

### <a></a>Current Features

The current version of a9s Redis for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **On­-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s Redis for PCF deploys Redis instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM Redis server using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each Redis server runs on a dedicated virtual machine to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Redis for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized applications.
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s Redis for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU and storage capacity for your Redis instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each Redis service instance provides log messages and Redis-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Redis for PCF service instances to their lastest version. |

### <a></a>Upcoming Features
The following features have been developed and tested on <a href="https://paas.anynines.com/" target="_blank">paas.anynines.com</a>. These features will be included in an upcoming a9s Redis for PCF release:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---|---|
| **On­-Demand Encrypted Remote Connectivity** | A public encrypted access can be established on demand. This connection can be used to perform manual backups. As soon as the public connection becomes obsolete, the tunnel can be terminated to prevent further access. This functionality is provided by additional components in the Service Jumper Module. |
| **High Availability** | a9s Redis for PCF ensures high-availability using Redis **Replication**.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. |
