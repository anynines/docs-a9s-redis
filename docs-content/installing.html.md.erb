This topic describes how to install and configure a9s Redis.


##<a id='install'></a> Install a9s Redis

To install a9s Redis, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-redis).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** or **+** (depending on the PCF version) next to the uploaded a9s Redis tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the new tile, then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings for each tab.
  For more information on how to configure the properties on each side-tab, see the following:
  * [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
  * [Plan Configuration](#plan_configuration)
  * [Backup Configuration](#backup_configuration)
  * [Syslog](#syslog)
  * [Configure BOSH Errands](#errands)
  * [Configure Resources](#resource-config)

5. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After you install the a9s Redis, it is available in the list of Marketplace services. For more information, see [Using a9s Redis for PCF](./using.html).


###<a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service component and service instance jobs. Configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

<%= image_tag("assign_azs_and_networks.png") %>

###<a id="plan_configuration"></a>Plan Configuration

Define the AZ placement where the service instances will be deployed.
Define the VM and persistent disk types.
VM and persistent disk types will be used in the service instance deployments. Disk size and VM size (CPUs and memory) can be configured independently, to create your desired plans, however you must consider that moving from a lager disk to a smaller disk is likely to fail.

####Minimum system requirements

Disk nano: 2 GB
Disk small: 4 GB
Disk medium: 10 GB
Disk large: 30 GB
VM nano: 1 CPU, 1 GB RAM, 4 GB Disk
VM small: 1 CPU, 2 GB RAM, 4 GB Disk
VM medium: 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 8 GB Disk
VM large: 4 CPU, 8 GB RAM, 30 GB Disk

<%= image_tag("plan_configuration.png") %>

###<a id="backup_configuration"></a>Backup Configuration

Use **Backup Configuration** to configure the backup endpoints. You can choose between a S3 compliant endpoint or an Azure blob store.

<%= image_tag("backup_configuration.png") %>

###<a id="syslog"></a>Syslog

a9s Redis provides the possibility to stream the logs of the service components to a syslog enpoint.
This has no effect on the service instances itself.

<%= image_tag("syslog.png") %>

###<a id='errands'></a>Configure Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the lifecycle errands that run when you install or uninstall a9s Redis. The list below describes each errand. For more information, see [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html).

<%= image_tag("errands.png") %>


#### Post-Deploy Errands

 * **Run Template Uploader**:
  This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s Redis with Redis  configurations.
  Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of all tiles.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Broker Registrar**:
  This errand registers the a9s Redis service broker
  at the Elastic Runtime. This makes the service available in the Marketplace.

 * **Run Smoke Tests**:
 This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s Redis
 installation to ensure that it is configured properly. Those tests may
 take a while, probably over 30 minutes.


#### Pre-Delete Errands

 * **Delete all a9s Redis instances**:
  This errand deletes all a9s Redis instances which were created with `cf create-service` by PCF end users.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This is an absoutly destructive task and can't be undone. All VMs of the service instances will be deleted irrecoverably. In the case a service instance is bound to an app or service keys are existing, the errand will fail.</p>

 * **Run Broker Deregistrar**:
  This will deregister the a9s Redis service broker in Pivotal Application Services. This errand removes the Redis service from the Marketplace.


###<a id='resource-config'></a> Configure Resources

You can configure the dimensions of the VMs that host the a9s Redis components.
This configuration does not cover the dedicated Redis instances that run on VMs provided.
For more information, see [Configure Service Plan VMs](#configure-service-instance).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: anynines recommends using a VM type of large or greater to support the tile compilation.</p>

<%= image_tag("resource_config.png") %>

##<a id='deployment_updater'></a>Update Existing Service Instances

After updating the a9s Redis tile, run the Deployment Updater errand to update all provisioned service instances to the new service and stemcell versions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: anynines recommends running the <a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">smoke tests</a> before running this errand.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To run the errand, you must know how to use the BOSH Director. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare" target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a>.</p>

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM:
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
Password: ***********
</pre>

2. Log in to the BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh login
Your username: director
Enter password: DIRECTOR\_CREDENTIAL
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>

3. Run `bosh deployments` and record the name of the a9s Redis deployment from the **Name** column:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployments
Using environment '172.28.10.11' as client 'ops_manager'

Name                                 Release(s)                            Stemcell(s)                                       Team(s)                              Cloud Config

                                     uaa/52.7
</pre>

4. Run `bosh -d a9s-redis-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd run errand deployment-updater` to force the update for all existing a9s Redis instances:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -d a9s-redis-0476d61a219a39bf0e1b run-errand deployment-updater
Using environment '172.28.10.11' as client 'ops_manager'

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the number of service instances, the Deployment Updater may take significant time to finish running. BOSH shows no logging output while the errand runs.</p>

##<a id='interacting-with-the-backup-manager'></a> Trigger Backups and Restores on Demand

PCF administrators can interact with the Backup Manager
endpoints to trigger immediate backups and restore backups.

To backup, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Status** tab of the tile and record the IP address of one of the a9s Ancillary Service instances.

    <%= image_tag("status_tab.png", width: 300) %>

2. On the **Credentials** tab, find the credentials of the service under **Backup Manager Password**.

2. Trigger a backup on all instances by calling the **/backup\_agent/backup\_all** endpoint:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup\_agent/backup\_all -d {}
</pre>
or on a given instance with its GUID by calling the **/backup\_agent/backup**
endpoint:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup\_agent/backup -d "instance\_guid=1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9"
</pre>

To restore, perform the following steps:

3. Find the ID of the Backup and the ID of the instance by listing the instances:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/instances
</pre>
This command outputs an array composed of objects like this one:
<pre class="terminal">
{
  "restores": [],
  "backups": [
    {
      "backup\_agent\_task": {
        "updated\_at": "2017-05-19T09:01:31.389Z",
        "created\_at": "2017-05-19T09:01:16.064Z",
        "status": "done",
        "task\_id": 5,
        "id": 5
      },
      "instance\_id": 1,
      "id": 5
    }
  ],
  "instance\_id": "1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9",
  "id": 1
}
</pre>
In the example above, backups and restores that have been performed for
the instance with the instance\_id `1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9`.
This ID corresponds to the instance GUID from PCF.

4. Restore the backup by calling the **/backup\_agent/restores**
endpoint with the backup\_id and instance\_id as data:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup\_agent/restores -d "backup\_id=5" -d "instance\_id=1"
</pre>
