## Use a9s Redis with an Application

To use a9s Redis with an application, create a service instance and bind the service instance
to your app. For more information about managing service instances, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

### View the a9s Redis Service

After the tile is installed, you can see the `a9s-redis32` and its service plans appear in your CF marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to see the service listing:

´´´bash
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org test / space test as admin...
OK
service        plans                                                                           description
a9s-redis32    redis-single-small, redis-single-big, redis-cluster-small, redis-cluster-big    This is the anynines Redis 32 service.
´´´

### Create a Service Instance

To provision a Redis database, run `cf create-service`. For example.

´´´bash
$ cf create-service a9s-redis32 redis-single-small my-redis-service
´´´

Depending on your infrastructure and service broker utilization, it might take several minutes to create the service instance.

Run the `cf services` command to view the creation status. This command displays a list of all your service instances. To view the status of a specific service instance, run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.

### Bind an Application to a Service Instance

After your database is created, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to your application:

´´´bash
$ cf bind-service a9s-redis-app my-redis-service
´´´

### Restage or Restart Your Application

To enable your application to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or `cf restart` to restage or restart your application.

### Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After a service instance is bound to an application, the credentials of your Redis database are stored in the environment variables of the application. Run `cf env APP-NAME` to display the environment variables.

You can find the credentials in the [VCAP_SERVICES](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) key.

´´´bash
$ cf env a9s-redis-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-redis-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "a9s-redis": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "host": "EXAMPLE-HOST",
     "password": "EXAMPLE-PWD",
     "port": 6379
    },
    "label": "a9s-redis",
    "name": "my-redis-service",
    "plan": "redis-single-non-persistent-small",
   }
  ]
 }
}
...
´´´

You can use the host and password values to connect to your database with a Redis client.

## Delete an a9s Redis Service Instance

*WARNING: Before deleting a service instance, you must backup data stored in your database. This operation cannot be undone and all the data is lost when the service is deleted.*

Before you can delete a service instance, you must unbind it from all apps.

### List Available Services

Run `cf services` to list available services.

´´´bash
$ cf services

Getting services in org test / space test as admin...
OK

name                 service       plan                   bound apps        last operation
my-redis-service     a9s-redis     redis-single-small     a9s-redis-app     create succeeded
´´´

This example shows that `my-redis-service` is bound to the `a9s-redis-app` application.

### Unbind a Service Instance

Run `cf unbind-service` to unbind the service from your app:

´´´bash
$ cf unbind-service a9s-redis-app my-redis-service
´´´

### Delete a Service Instance

After unbinding the service, it is no longer bound to an app. Run `cf delete-service` to delete the service:

´´´bash
$ cf delete-service my-redis-service
´´´

It may take several minutes to delete the service. Deleting a service deprovisions the corresponding infrastructure resources.
Run the `cf services` command to view the deletion status.


## Upgrade the Service Instance to another Service Plan

Once created, you can upgrade your service instance to another, larger service plan. A larger service plan provides more CPU, RAM and storage. For more information, see the  [Update a Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service) of the _Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI_ topic.

´´´bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -p a-bigger-plan
´´´

Here are the plans you can upgrade to depending on the one you are currently
using:

* If you are currently using the `redis-single-small` plan, you can upgrade to `redis-single-big` plan.
* If you are currently using the `redis-cluster-small` plan, you can upgrade to `redis-cluster-big` plan.

## Change RDB Persistence Settings

a9s Redis supports RDB persistence with point in time snapshots.
This setting can be changed by the user.

### Default Behavior

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| save 900 1 | Create a snapshot after 900 seconds if 1 write operations occurred. |
| save 300 10 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |
| save 60 10000 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |

### Configuring RDB
You can configure RDB according to the needs of your apps by providing customer settings. This setting must follow the original Redis configuration for RDB `-c {"snapshot": "['save 900 1', 'save 300 10']"}`.

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"snapshot": "['save 900 1', 'save 300 10']"}
´´´

In this example, it configures to snapshot the Redis database according to the following rules:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| save 900 1 | Create a snapshot after 900 seconds if 1 write operations occurred. |
| save 300 10 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |

### Cache Only
You can disable snapshots and use Redis as cache only by creating the service with the following customer setting `-c '{"snapshot": "[]"}'`.

The command is:

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"snapshot": "[]"}
´´´

For more information, see the snapshot settings in the documentation of [Redis Persistence](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).


## Change Maxmemory Policy

With the maxmemory\_policy, you can configure a9s Redis which key to
remove when maxmemory is reached. Ther are several configurable behaviors.
`noeviction` is the default.


| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| volatile-lru | remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm |
| allkeys-lru | remove any key according to the LRU algorithm |
| volatile-random | remove a random key with an expire set |
| allkeys-random | remove a random key, any key |
| volatile-ttl | remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL) |
| noeviction | don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations |


You can use `-c {"maxmemory_policy": "volatile-ttl"}` to update the maxmemory-policy.

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"maxmemory_policy": "volatile-ttl"}
´´´

For more information, see the maxmemory-policy settings in the self documented [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/redis.conf).

## HA Cluster with Redis Sentinel

a9s Redis uses [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) to provide a high available replication set.
Redis Sentinel is monitoring the several nodes, takes care about the automatic failover and is able to send notifcation when something in the cluster is changing.

a9s Redis provides two settings to adjust the cluster behaviour.
`min_slaves_max_lag` and `down_after_milliseconds`

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| min\_slaves\_max\_lag | Time in seconds how long the master waits before he stops accepting writes when slaves are no more reachable. Default is 10 seconds. min-slaves-to-write can not be changed, it is fxed set to 1. See [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/redis.conf) |
| down\_after\_milliseconds | Number of milliseconds the master should be unreachable in order to consider it in S_DOWN state. Default is 30000 ms. See [sentinel.conf](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/sentinel.conf) |


´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"min_slaves_max_lag": "10"}
´´´


´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"down_after_milliseconds": "30000"}
´´´

## Add a Graphite Endpoint

If you want to monitor your service with Graphite, you can set an endpoint to
where to information will be sent with the `cf update-service` command. This command expects the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding)
and a JSON string containing the `graphite` and `metrics_prefix` keys.
Depending on your graphite provider  the `metrics_prefix` might require that each metrics must start with an API key in their name. You can also change the interval within the data is send to the endpoint. Do to this modify `interval` the default is 10s.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-rabbitmq-service -c '{ "graphite": ["yourspace.your-graphite-endpoint.com:12345"], "metrics_prefix": "your-api-key.my-cluster-rabbitmq", "interval": "5"}'
```

## Add a Syslog Endpoint

The `cf update-service` command used with the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding) can let you stream your syslog to a third-party service. In this case, the command expects a JSON string containing the `syslog` key. You can also change the interval for the syslog with the same key than for the graphite endpoint `interval`.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-rabbitmq-service -c '{ "syslog": ["logs4.your-syslog-endpoint.com:54321"], "interval": "5" }'
```

## Cloud Foundry Application Security Groups

This topic describes how to check whether a security group was created.

Each a9s Data Service will automatically create and update Cloud Foundry security groups in order to protected service instances to be accessed by applications not running in the same Cloud Foundry applications space.
To get a better understanding about Security Groups you can have a look on the
[Understanding Application Security Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/asg.html) topic.

### Get Service Instance GUID

Run `cf service INSTANCE_NAME --guid` to get the guid of the service instance.

```bash
$ cf service my-rabbitmq --guid
ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028
```

### Check available Security Groups

To see all available security groups use `cf security-groups`.

```
$cf security-groups
Getting security groups as demo@anynines.com
OK

     Name                                         Organization     Space
#0   public_networks
#1   dns
#2   tcp_open
#3   guard_432fb752-876d-443b-a311-a075f4df2237   demonstrations   demo
#4   guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028   demonstrations   demo
```

There we can see a security group with the named `guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028`
was successfully created.

*NOTE: in some circumstances the connection between the application and the service instance is not possible, in this case check if a security group was created.*

## Backup and Restore Service Instances

a9s RabbitMQ provides an easy way to create backups and restore if needed.

### Get Dashboard Address, Login and Authorize

1. Grap the dashboard URL with `cf service SERVICE-NAME`.
  ```bash
  $cf service my-rabbitmq

  Service instance: my-rabbitmq
  Service: a9s-rabbitmq
  Bound apps:
  Tags:
  Plan: rabbitmq-single-small
  Description: This is a service creating and managing dedicated RabbitMQ service instances and clusters, powered by the anynines Service Framework
  Documentation url:
  Dashboard: https://a9s-rabbitmq-dashboard.aws.ie.a9s.eu/service-instances/ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028

  Last Operation
  Status: update succeeded
  Message:
  Started: 2017-10-26T08:28:38Z
  Updated: 2017-10-26T08:28:38Z
  ```

2. Browse to the dashboard URL and authenticate on the redirected page with your Cloud Foundry credentials:
<%= image_tag("authentication-page.png") %>

3. Click **Authorize** to approve the authorization request:
<%= image_tag("authorization-page.png") %>

### Perform a Backup

On the dashboard as shown above you can trigger a backup by clicking **Trigger backup**

<%= image_tag("service-dashboard.png") %>

After a short period of time the backup will be queued. The backup process will start soon.

<%= image_tag("service-dashboard-bkp-triggered.png") %>

*NOTE: Depending on the size of the data the backup will take some time.*

### Restore a Backup

Open the dashboard again and select the backup you would like to restore.
Click the **Restore** button of the backup. After a short period of time the restore will be triggered.

<%= image_tag("service-dashboard-restore-triggered.png") %>

*NOTE: Same as the backup, depending on the size of the data, the restore will take some time.*

<%= image_tag("service-dashboard-final.png") %>

## Make a Service Instance Locally Available

It is possible to access any of the a9s Data Services locally. That means you can connect with a local client to the service for any purpose such as debbuging.
CF provides a smart way to create SSH forward tunnels via a pushed application.
For more information about this feature see the [Accessing Apps with SSH](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html) section of the CF documentation.

First of all you must have an application bound to the service. How to do this see [Bind an Application to a Service Instance](#bind-an-application-to-a-service-instance).

*NOTE: `cf ssh` support must be enabled in the platform. Ask your administrator if you are not sure.*

### Get The Service Url and Credentials

When you follow this instructions [Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials](#obtain-service-instance-access-credentials) you will get the hostname of the service and the user credentials.

```bash
$ cf env a9s-redis-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-redis-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
   "a9s-redis": [
    {
      "credentials": {
       "host": [
        "d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs"
       ],
       "password": "a9s-brk-usr",
       "username": "a9s-password"
     },
     "label": "a9s-redis",
     "name": "my-redis-service",
     "plan": "redis-cluster-small"
    }
   ]
  }
}
...
```

Notice the host `d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs`, the username `a9s-brk-usr` and the password `a9s-password`. You will need this in the next step.

### Create a Tunnel to The Service

With the `cf ssh` as mentioned before you can create a ssh forward tunnel to the management dashboard.
Use port 6379 to connect to the a9s Redis Instance.

```bash
$ cf ssh a9s-redis-app -L 6379:d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs:6379
vcap@956aaf4e-6da9-4f69-4b1d-8e631a403312:~$
```

When the ssh tunnel is open you can access the instance over the address `localhost:6379`.

*NOTE: Don't forget to close the session with `exit`.*
